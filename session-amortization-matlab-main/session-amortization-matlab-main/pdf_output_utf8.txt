troduces Bernstein reconstruction in polynomial multiplication to achieve minimal computation cost; hence,
resource-limited IoT devices are viable to use the reliable authentication mutually. This approach offers indef-
inite identity privacy and location privacy. Hence, the proposed signature generation and verification process are
highly efficient compared to the existing ring signature systems. Also, the proposed post-quantum hybrid code-
based encryption scheme follows Diagonal Structure Based QCΓÇæLDPC Codes with column loop optimization and
Simplified Log Domain Sum-Product Algorithm (SLDSPA) to provide the function of light weight encryption with
minimum hardware requirements. The total authentication delay of the proposed authentication scheme is 23%
less than the authentication scheme that is considered conventional polynomial multiplication. Also, the opti-
mized design of the proposed code based HE uses only 64 slices and 640 slices on Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA for
encoding and decoding processes, respectively. These simulation results prove the effectiveness of the proposed
cryptographic scheme against other competitive systems in terms of its functionality and hardware complexities.

head nodes and sensing nodes. Here, the sensing node transmits its
sensed data towards its cluster head node, and then the cluster head
node transmits the data to the gateway node. Every entity transmits its
data via a wireless link in a hierarchical IoT network. Nowadays,
emerging applications in the area of IoT have been developed to inter-
connect numerous digital devices to the internet to exchange informa-
tion. However, while exchanging information from one device to
another, security is the major concern because of authentication and
privacy. Here, the entities users, sensing nodes and cluster heads pre-
sented in the hierarchical IoT are not trustworthy. The most significant
entity of the hierarchical IoTs is the gateway node. Hence, it is consid-
ered a trusted node and is not compromised in any situation.
This paper introduces a new ring network structure with local
authentication and data sharing entities. Here, the Ring structures
deliver authorization services for locally registered entities (IoT de-
vices), and the same structures can be extended to accomplish trust re-
lations with other rings globally. Hence, smart IoT devices such as
